                    <p>The note at the end refers to the libraries that ClanLib may use. The
                    ClanLib license only applies to the ClanLib source code itself; each of the
                    dependency libraries used by your project has a license as well, which
                    must be respected. For example, the libvorbis license must be respected if
                    you use clanVorbis.</p>

                    <p>Earlier versions of ClanLib used the GNU Lesser General Public License.</p>
