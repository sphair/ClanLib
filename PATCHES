If you have fixed or added something to ClanLib, here is a description
how to get those changes included in the official repository.

Diffing using SVN
===================================
Use 'diff -u > mypatch.patch' or 'svn diff > mypatch.patch' from within
the ClanLib (trunk) directory. This is contextual diff, it provides more
information so it easier to examine the changes before applying.

If you're using Windows, the TortoiseSVN utility
(http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/) can easily create patches. Right click
your ClanLib directory (or trunk), and select TortoiseSVN->Create Patch.

Diffing using GIT
===================================
TODO

Submitting
===================================
Please submit patches to our development forum:
Go to http://www.clanlib.org, click Forum, and go to Developer Chat subforum.

Describing
===================================
You should describe what your patch does. Please no 'This fixes a bug'.
Tell us which bug, in what component. Generally, be descriptive without
being being needlessly verbose.
