/*
 * The following structure is the ClanLib file reader driver for MikMod.
 * In fact MikMod core functions expect an MREADER struct, so the first
 * field of MCLANLIBREADER (core) is an MREADER, and this way the MikMod
 * code can access correctly all the fields of the MREADER core struct,
 * while we provide an additionnal pointer (input) to handle the file,
 * which is a clan::IODevice in ClanLib's case.
 * This method might look like an ugly hack but MikMod does this internally,
 * with an MFILEREADER struct casted an into a plain MREADER.
