	/// \brief DOM Text class.
	///
	///    <p>The Text interface represents the textual content (termed character data
	///    in XML) of an Element or Attr. If there is no markup inside an element's content,
	///    the text is contained in a single object implementing the Text interface that is
	///    the only child of the element. If there is markup, it is parsed into a list of
	///    elements and Text nodes that form the list of children of the element.</p>
	///    <p>When a document is first made available via the DOM, there is only one Text
	///    node for each block of text. Users may create adjacent Text nodes that represent
	///    the contents of a given element without any intervening markup, but should be aware
	///    that there is no way to represent the separations between these nodes in XML or HTML,
	///    so they will not (in general) persist between DOM editing sessions. The normalize()
	///    method on Element merges any such adjacent Text objects into a single node for each
	///    block of text; this is recommended before employing operations that depend on a
	///    particular document structure, such as navigation with XPointers.</p>
