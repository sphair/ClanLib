	/// \brief DOM Attribute class.
	///
	///    <p>The Attr interface represents an attribute in an Element object. Typically
	///    the allowable values for the attribute are defined in a document type definition.</p>
	///    <p>Attr objects inherit the Node interface, but since they are not actually child
	///    nodes of the element they describe, the DOM does not consider them part of the
	///    document tree. Thus, the Node attributes parentNode, previousSibling, and nextSibling
	///    have a null value for Attr objects. The DOM takes the view that attributes are
	///    properties of elements rather than having a separate identity from the elements
	///    they are associated with; this should make it more efficient to implement such
	///    features as default attributes associated with all elements of a given type. Furthermore,
	///    Attr nodes may not be immediate children of a DocumentFragment. However, they can
	///    be associated with Element nodes contained within a DocumentFragment. In short,
	///    users and implementors of the DOM need to be aware that Attr nodes have some
	///    things in common with other objects inheriting the Node interface, but they also
	///    are quite distinct.</p>
	///    <p>The attribute's effective value is determined as follows: if this attribute
	///    has been explicitly assigned any value, that value is the attribute's effective
	///    value; otherwise, if there is a declaration for this attribute, and that declaration
	///    includes a default value, then that default value is the attribute's effective value;
	///    otherwise, the attribute does not exist on this element in the structure model until
	///    it has been explicitly added. Note that the nodeValue attribute on the Attr instance
	///    can also be used to retrieve the string version of the attribute's value(s).</p>
	///    <p>In XML, where the value of an attribute can contain entity references, the child
	///    nodes of the Attr node provide a representation in which entity references are not
	///    expanded. These child nodes may be either Text or EntityReference nodes. Because the
	///    attribute type may be unknown, there are no tokenized attribute values.</p>
