	/// \brief DOM Document Fragment class.
	///
	///    <p>DocumentFragment is a "lightweight" or "minimal" Document object. It
	///    is very common to want to be able to extract a portion of a document's
	///    tree or to create a new fragment of a document. Imagine implementing a
	///    user command like cut or rearranging a document by moving fragments
	///    around. It is desirable to have an object which can hold such fragments
	///    and it is quite natural to use a Node for this purpose. While it is true
	///    that a Document object could fulfil this role, a Document object can
	///    potentially be a heavyweight object, depending on the underlying
	///    implementation. What is really needed for this is a very lightweight
	///    object. DocumentFragment is such an object.</p>
	///    <p>Furthermore, various operations -- such as inserting nodes as children
	///    of another Node -- may take DocumentFragment objects as arguments; this
	///    results in all the child nodes of the DocumentFragment being moved to the
	///    child list of this node.</p>
	///    <p>The children of a DocumentFragment node are zero or more nodes
	///    representing the tops of any sub-trees defining the structure of the
	///    document. DocumentFragment nodes do not need to be well-formed XML documents
	///    (although they do need to follow the rules imposed upon well-formed XML
	///    parsed entities, which can have multiple top nodes). For example, a
	///    DocumentFragment might have only one child and that child node could be
	///    a Text node. Such a structure model represents neither an HTML document
	///    nor a well-formed XML document.</p>
	///    <p>When a DocumentFragment is inserted into a Document (or indeed any
	///    other Node that may take children) the children of the DocumentFragment
	///    and not the DocumentFragment itself are inserted into the Node. This
	///    makes the DocumentFragment very useful when the user wishes to create
	///    nodes that are siblings; the DocumentFragment acts as the parent of these
	///    nodes so that the user can use the standard methods from the Node interface,
	///    such as insertBefore() and appendChild().</p>
