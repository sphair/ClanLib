	///   <p>CDATA sections are used to escape blocks of text containing characters that would
	///    otherwise be regarded as markup. The only delimiter that is recognized in a CDATA
	///    section is the "]]>" string that ends the CDATA section. CDATA sections can not be
	///    nested. The primary purpose is for including material such as XML fragments, without
	///    needing to escape all the delimiters.</p>
	///    <p>The DOMString attribute of the Text node holds the text that is contained by the
	///    CDATA section. Note that this may contain characters that need to be escaped outside
	///    of CDATA sections and that, depending on the character encoding ("charset") chosen
	///    for serialization, it may be impossible to write out some characters as part of a
	///    CDATA section.</p>
	///    <p>The CDATASection interface inherits the CharacterData interface through the Text
	///    interface. Adjacent CDATASections nodes are not merged by use of the Element.normalize()
	///    method.</p>
