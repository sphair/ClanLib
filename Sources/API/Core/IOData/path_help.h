		///
		/// \return The converted path
		///
		/// This function behaves differently depending on OS and path_type.
		/// In Windows, if the relative_path begins with a drive letter, and
		/// the driver letter differs from the base path, the path is
		/// converted to an absolute path using the current directory for that
		/// drive. Likewise, if the specified base path does not include a
		/// drive or its path is not absolute, the current drive and directory
		/// is added. The function converts all slashes to backslashes.
		///
		/// If the OS is unix based, there is no location (drive or share name)
		/// and the function also converts all backslashes to slashes.
		///
		/// If the type is path_type_virtual, the base path is required to be
		/// absolute. If it does not start in a slash, the function prefixes a
		/// slash to the path. The current drive or directory is never taken into
		/// account and all backslashes are converted to slashes.
		///
		/// This function calls normalise() on base_path and relative_path.
		///
		/// Example #1:
		/// \code
		/// std::string str = PathHelp::make_absolute("ABD/DEF/", "GFX/Filename.txt", PathHelp::path_type_file);
		/// On Linux: str = "/home/user/ABD/DEF/GFX/Filename.txt"
