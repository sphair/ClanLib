	/// <p>The position is transformed by the modelview matrix when glLight is called
	///    (just as if it were a point), and it is stored in eye coordinates. If the w
	///    component of the position is 0.0, the light is treated as a directional source.</p>
	///    <p>Diffuse and specular lighting calculations take the lights direction, but not
	///    its actual position, into account, and attenuation is disabled. Otherwise, diffuse
	///    and specular lighting calculations are based on the actual location of the light
	///    in eye coordinates, and attenuation is enabled.</p>
	///    <p>The default position is (0,0,1,0); thus, the default light source is directional,
	///    parallel to, and in the direction of the x axis.</p>
